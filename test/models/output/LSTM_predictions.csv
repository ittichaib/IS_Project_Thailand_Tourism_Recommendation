If your visit Thailand, it would not be complete without a visit to Doi Suthep.

Here you will find stairs that are 309 steps high. At the top, is the famous Theravada
Buddha temple called “Wat Phra That Doi Suthep”. I’m told this site hold the bones of the former leaders.

Here you will find many of other things like other temples, statues, info on Buddha, etc. Everything is in gold. Not sure about the authenticity of the gold but it does look real.

Climb the stairs or ride the escalator?

The temple is 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from the city of Chiang Mai and situated at an elevation of 1,073 meters.

Theravada ‘School of the Elders' is the most commonly accepted name of Buddhism's oldest existing school.

So, you are basically visiting a historic site and national monument.

Taxies and cars would often cut across them to get to the river.  WOW! things have changed.  As we drove around the curve This magnificent structure appeared surrounded by a smoothed masonry wall with gleaming stainless steel inserts.  My wife advised me there was an attempt to raise the old wooden structure because of the water damage through the annual rainy seasons but it failed and partly collapsed, making it a complete total loss.   The new Wat is a white building trimmed in gold, very ornate, built in the Thai style, except for the reddish brown tile roof, instead of the traditional orange ones. Inside is breath taking.

Seating, however, is just average. It's not exactly uncomfortable, but it can feel a bit cramped when the arena is full.

The complex has a good number of restaurants and enough restrooms. But, it falls short when it comes to an adequate waiting area outside the arena. Additionally, accessibility for guests with disabilities isn't the best, mainly because of unclear signage.

A notable downside is the transportation. The arena doesn't connect well with public transit, making it tricky to arrive and leave. Taxis are not only hard to find but often charge higher rates, and there's no organized taxi queue. The lack of nearby bus or train options means many visitors have to use private transport. However, parking is a hassle, with high fees and often heavy traffic. For big events, it might be a good idea to stay at a nearby hotel to avoid these transportation woes.

We made it to the golf course in 35 minutes, a record for our group traveling from one of the tourist centers of Bangkok.  

Check in was smooth.  There pro shop was staffed and adequately stocked with new items and, for a hacker like me, some very clean and locally packaged gently used golf balls.  The green, cart and caddie fee was TB1600.  They take only Thai Baht. 

The men's locker room is clean, newer, air conditioned and spacious.   

The starter did not take control.  We were very early and could have started our game early.  When we saw other players approaching, we went to T-off and then were stopped.  He was seriously complacent.  Well, we eventually T'd off and played golf!

The fareways are wide and seeded with a local Thai grass.  The grounds crew were cutting this day and the fairway was littered with excess cut grass.  It had rained the night before and the roll of the course limited.  Yes, we had to manage the course!  

There is water to be aware of.  Sometimes the water is on a side, other times hidden over a small rise in the fairway and  the last green is surrounded by water.  Our caddies knew the course and did tell us the distances to the water traps in broken English. 

This is a very good local course located just north of Don Muenge Airport.  I recommend golfers and hackers alike to include it in a self administered Thai golf vacation.

The grounds are lovely, the whole place bears spending some time in reflection and meditation.  Not far from the Amari Buriram Hotel, where I was always stay. but will be hard to get to without your own wheels. 
I highly recommend using a local driver I use when I'm in Buriram, Khun Oi.
She's an excellent driver, knows the area well, has great english. Khun Oi is a lovely tour guide, driver and negotiator.
Booking a trip to Wat Khao Noi (which Khun Oi turned me onto) can be combined to a trip to Huai Chorakhe Mak,  
Huai Chorakhe Mak is a lovely wildlife preserve built on two lakes. They're are bridged by a lovely long walkway along the water front, simply spectacular. There's a lovely path that rings the lakes and you can rent bikes there and do the route easily on a bike. I just love this place and visit each time I'm in Buriram.  Also gorgeous at sunset and not far from Wat Khao Noi, just on the other side of the highway really.

558,17642639.0,Harem By Suzy Wong's,Solo travel,3.0,0.0,"I got talking to a girl in Devil's Playground (Suzie Wong II?) and she told me that the Suzie Wong organisation now controls about seven clubs in that area of Patong and I believe they are all operating on the same model. That being a girl sits with you, you buy her a 'lady drink' which is inevitably a TINY shot of Tequila for 250 Baht which she drinks quite quickly after which she looks at you expecting you to buy her another one. (The bottle of local beer I had cost (I think) 140 or 150 Baht). I also went to Harem and in there one girl was pushing me to buy her two drinks at once!) In exchange for this she may or may not sit or stand close to you and may or may not encourage you to put your hands on her. It could therefore be said to be an outrageous rip off but . . . we all know that right?

The girl in Devil's Playground also told me that the standard bar fine in these clubs is 2,000 Baht. The girls in these places are of a very high standard and the music in Harem and Devil's Playground is usually cool dance music. I don't go in Suzy Wong's because I don't like watching women trying to grind to rock music. But of course whether you have a good time or not all depends on the girl. If she's into you then you probably will but if she isn't then you won't. The problem some guys find with the relatively 'upmarket' places where the more attractive girls work is that they often exercise their right to say no. Sneaky attempts to gouge as much money from the customer as possible may be precede this brush off. Don't be surprised by this. Instead take a look in the mirror and ask why you've been blown out.

I've given three stars because the girls are usually hot, the staff are friendly, the venues are ok and the music is often very good.

I would like to start with the positives first. Girls are mostly beautiful. Bar tenders, servers all are polite & did their jobs fairly well on all my 4 visits.. Music & space, sofas seating space was good. Drinks were fairly priced & good. Having said all this I would have rated it 5 out of 5 as I still consider it as one of the best bar not only in phuket but in Thailand however on my last 2 visits there were things occurred which spoiled the rating from 5 to 3.

Girl NADIA - On my 2nd visit I spotted her & I liked her very much so I asked her for drink with me but seems she was busy with other customers which I understood so while leaving I asked her if she can have a drink with me tomorrow on which she quickly agreed. I asked her twice & she agreed on both occasion that she will have drink with me tomorrow. I visited early next day & I saw her. So I asked her for a drink for which she did not even respond at all!! This was upsetting . I asked little later again but she did not even respond!! I felt disrespected not because she did not honor her own words but she did not even bother to pay any attention & say no to me.. I can accept no but what is this? Not even honoring your own words taking which the customer revisited your club.. If you don't want to drink then say at least no respectfully specially when your yourself said yes yesterday to have a drink today.. Say NO that is your right but at least respond with respect instead of ignoring the customer's request & making ugly & rude gestures . 

Even after this incident I would have rated the club at least 4 out of 5 by ignoring the incident with NADIA but similar but even worst incident occurred later days on my 3rd & 4th visit..
On my 3rd visit  I liked one girl very much her name was similar to the first one but I think it spells out little differently Nadee Or Nadeen Or Naadeen. Please check you would know.. She is tall & black open hair . I asked her for a drink with me & she came for a drink. I liked her so I asked her if she can come out with me for 1 hour she asked for 6000 & 2000 bar fine and I convinced her for 5000  & 2000 bar fine but I requested her for an appointment next day as I was very tired as I was travelling whole day & it was already 2 am. She gave me appointment time next day after mid night and we had & agreement. I bought her 3 lady drinks on our first meet & everything went fine till here. Next day as per our agreement I came by 11pm & I found her busy with other customers so I waited for her to be free. After 30 min when she got free I approached her & asked her going with me  for 1 hour as per our agreement but she refused & stated that she needs to work on the bar so I said fine I can wait till her shift is over I. E 3 am.. She did not respond to that & said she can only drink with me in the bar but can't go out.. Her english was hard to understand so I did not get the exact reason of her U turn & not being able to honor her words.i thought she was saying lady drinks first so I ordered few lady drinks for her & again asked her multiple times but she kept on saying no.. We had drinks and lap dance for almost 30 min for which I ended up paying 3000 but she refused.. Now this is very interesting.. She kept on asking for drinks & tips & I continued paying & ordering drinks for her but when I was leaving she asked for 3000 thb one drink & said if I buy this 3000 thb one drink she will not only stay with me for some more time but will go out with me next time for free!!!!! Do you think anyone will buy this offer. You couldn't honor your words & not ready to go out for 7000 thb but you are promising the customer that on next visit you will go for free!!She was good but misleading the customers making false promises to buy lady drinks & tips!! & when the time comes for honoring your words you take U turn!!

Just behind them, locals have set up stalls selling the catch  -  fish, crabs, many varieties of prawns, and many varieties of shellfish.  This seafood market is popular with locals because the prices are right.

Beyond that are many small cabin-type seafood restaurants with deckchairs and tables set out on the beach in front of them.  This is an ideal way to have a relaxing seafood lunch, or even dinner as you watch the sunset out beyond Koh Samet (Samet Island), just offshore.

We saw coach loads of people gathering at the temple with small bottles of oil, little bits of paper (for wishes?) and some  gold leaf which they stuck onto the already very golden Buddha .. but I guess a few more  thin leaves of gold was highly appreciated and prayers would be answered more quickly

Live frogs gasping for air, small turtles, eels, ( well, I think  they were eels) it was all a bit too too  much for me, as an animal lover I totally object to these creatures being sold alive to be cooked in a pot & eaten.

It is located north-west of Bueng Phlan Chai Lake and exactly north of the Monument of Phra Khattiyawongsa, the first ruler of Roi-et. For Thai-temple enthusiasts it has some interesting things to offer.

There is a 1200 year old chedi made from bricks. In contrary to most chedis in Thailand, this one though bell-shaped like the others, has four corners.

Behind this unusual chedi are three Buddha statues that are completely black with a shiny surface. Some sources on the internet say that a black Buddha shows a connection to Buddhism, spreading to African regions. Some of black Buddha images in India even show African facial features. But Here in Roi Et I was unable to obtain any proof for this part of history.

On entering the compound, you will pass a 39 metre tall and colourful Buddha image in meditating pose. Underneath is a prayer hall with the regular gold coloured Buddha statue, that is surrounded by several life-sized wax figures of (I assume) famous monks of the recent past.

If you go there alone and not in the high-season, you might be lucky enough (like I was) to be given the “grand tour of the house” by a very friendly monk and a female temple staff. Basic knowledge of some conversational Thai would definitely enhance the chat and make the meeting as enjoyable for you as it was for me. Being invited like this, by people who did not speak a single word of English made it obvious to me how less Wat Nuea is frequented by foreign visitors, but still: they approached me and spent almost an hour showing me around. And no one asked for money or a donation. Of course I donated happily to the temple before leaving.

In a quiet rural environment ten km south of Chiang Mai, it was built in 1858 and is basically still the same set of wooden, tile-roofed buildings, carefully and tastefully renovated over the years.  The viharn has a graceful, triple tiered roof and the woodwork around the entrance doors feature intricate carvings of birds, plants and mythical animals, some of them gilded or decorated with colored glass.  Stucco sculptures of serpent nagas emerging from mouths of makaras, a kind of hybrid crocodile, flank the stairway.  The interior features a large Buddha, but little else.  Only a fragment remains visible of the original murals.
       The other main compound building is the cruciform-shaped, open sided pavilion (mondop).  Also made of teakwood with tiled roofs, it originally served as quarters for a stopover of a procession of a Buddha relic from Chomthong to Chiang Mai.  The building is unique in Northern Thailand.  Now Wat Ton Kwen is no longer an active temple; maintained and preserved, but not a residence for monks.  Across the road from the compound entrance lies a pool with a wooden plank bridge across it and a few empty stilted houses.  Between the pond and the temple are the towering sugar palms that gave the temple its name.
       To reach Wat Ton Kwen, also called Wat Inthrawat, take the road going south alongside the canal west of the city.  Around the 10 km mark is the Ton Kwen intersection.

 As for the game arcade zone, it's fun to play and has a lot of variety, but it's a bit difficult to play. I think before you come to play, you have to think carefully.  You have to spend quite a bit of money.

 The last zone is the sales zone. There are clothes, toys, and a variety of items for sale at prices that are appropriate for the products.

The Temple is set in lovely grounds and there is parking space outside in the road as well as the grounds. 
This is a very religious place for all visitors whether Thai Buddhists or those from another country and it's important to respect the many shrines that are here. Also shoes need to be taken off and left outside when actually going inside the Temple itself, again as a mark of respect. It is okay to take photographs though. The horses and dragons/serpents I believe are made from some kind of wax- they are amazing - although I can't be certain of that fact. Thai people believe that the Dragon and indeed praying to Buddha brings, good health, healing and even good luck for the future. There are monks who look after the place and any donations given by Thai People or Tourists- whether it be by buying flowers or candles or incense - all go to the upkeep of the place. I think this probably applies to many Buddhist Temples in Thailand.

What a beautiful temple on the hilltop between Roi Et and Mukdahan in NE Thailand. Not so close to Roi Et, closer to Mukdahan really, It is in Roi Et province but right on the border.
4 levels and a serpentine staircase up into the dome. The 360 Outside view is wonderful but inside is spectacular.  It is the combination of central region and northeastern region art style;  white with golden decoration. This is the first time I have seen stained glass or a likeness of it in a Thai temple.

The scene was truly fantastic and the cool-season nesting site attracted thousands of human visitors to see the fabulous sight of the graceful migratory birds.  The stork chicks and fledglings were especially endearing to observe!

For years, the human visitors spent considerable amounts of money on snacks and drinks and obviously contributed generously to the temple during their pilgrimages to the stork sanctuary.  In a stupendously idiotic tragedy, however, the temple abbot and decision makers went on a huge construction binge, knocking down trees, piling up construction materials, making loud disturbing noises, and otherwise making the area unattractive to the nesting storks. To make a long story short, they managed to ""kill the storks that laid the golden eggs.""  The storks got fed up with the disruptions to their mating and nesting and abruptly stopped returning to the temple grounds about five years ago (various reports are that the storks are now nesting in Buriram, Nakon Sawong, Nakon Chaisi, and elsewhere).

By:Hanna Kim    

Introduction 
->Do you want to see the museum that tells everything about rocks? If you do, you made a good choice reading this review! This museum talks about minerals and rocks, but it even teaches about the earth. And this museum even sells a collection of rocks and minerals. If you are learning about minerals and rocks at your school for science, you made a great choice! C’mon, what are you waiting for? Read along, see what it has!
 

Of Course, Lot of Teaching! 
->This amazing museum has a lot a teaching. You see, down, up, left, right, it all has millions of teaching. It even teaches you how rocks are made. This is one fact that I learned from there. Every rock in the world is always from a volcano. Every fact has an little picture explaining. This fact has an picture with a cycle. It teaches at first how the rock was made, how it gets soft, and how it gets hard. Now you will think how could a rock could be soft? But it is true. Before it gets hard, the rock will be soft. It gets hard because all of the rain, wind, and the sun! Before I didn’t go to the museum, I didn’t know even a tiny bit of rocks and museum. But now, I know way more than my 14 years old big sister. Now you know Geological Recourse Museum’s first reason to go. But there is two more reasons to go, so don’t be tired reading now!    

Some Kind of Special! 
->Geological Recourse Museum has some kind of special! It means it has a special event. Are you sad I said event, not events? If you hear what I say you will be happy than sad. Are you ready to listen? All righty then, really? Okay, it has a place where you can find a fossil with a brush. Like there is a place where’s sand over the sand. Get it? And one more thing is there is no people but they could go any moment. So if you go faster, the better. Are you very excited now that you are begging your parents now? You would be never sad if you try the event. Trust me, it’s true!	

Best Place Ever!	
->Now you heard my two reasons but remember there is one more reason left! I told you there was a museum that had lot of teaching and some kind of special. But there is one more to hear! Next to the Geological Recourse Museum, there is a shop where you can buy rocks and minerals. I told you there was somewhere where you could buy mineral and rock collections but this is a different place! But sometimes the shop closed. But you could still go  next to the shop and look what there is! Even though the shop is closed, there is a place where there is rocks and minerals lying on the floor. And the best part is that it’s... FREE!!! I didn’t buy the rocks on the shop but sometimes it better if you do. You have to make a good choice. It’s your choice!

Conclusion:   
->Now you heard my three reasons are you going to run out of your house? If you like this review, you’re going to like my other ones, too. I hope you enjoy your trip! Remember, the faster you go, the better!",2,2,P03007682,Pathum Thani,joy,330967431.0

Tha Phae Gate is located at the heart of the city, offering convenient access to explore the surrounding area. There are plenty of restaurants and bars nearby, providing opportunities for dining and entertainment.

I'm not overly interested in wars, but this museum is very well laid out and has artefacts, costumes, photos, dioramas and good interpretation in both Thai and English, so that it has something for everyone, no matter what their level of interest.

There are still a few slippery spots, however, so visitors should proceed with caution.

The cave has some very nice formations and quite a sizeable bat colony (plenty of guano to stick to your shoes!).  The big attraction for me, however, was the presence of a very large number of cave crickets with incredibly long antennae (approx 20 centimetres in length). This was the biggest population of cave crickets I've seen in Thailand.  Visitors must respect the fragility of the cave ecosystem and avoid disturbance of the crickets and bats.

From Wikipedia we learn that In 1907 the Thai-Cambodian border was mapped by the French on behalf of a bilateral border commission. According to the 1904 agreement, the border would follow the natural watershed between the countries. However, the resulting map deviated by showing Preah Vihear Temple as being in Cambodia, even though it is on the Thai side of the watershed. Thailand accepted the map for official use. The Thais discovered the error when they made their own survey in the 1930s, but the International Court of Justice ruled that they had waited too long to protest and lost the temple by ""acquiescence"". 
So now you can only visit the temple from the Cambodian side. For those with strong interest in the political and historical aspects one could go in from the Thai side. Entrance is 400 baht for a foreigner. But for the politically not interested there is not much to see. You can follow a path (""up along the flower pots"") where you run into a small army settlement and barbed wire to stop you from going further. In the far distance you can see the stairs go up.

📍 10 THB per person to ride the elevator 

Off the beaten path lies Wat Samphran, also known as the “Dragon Temple.” It is located approximately 15 min from After the Rain Coffee & Gallery (20 min from Bubble in the Forest Cafe).

There is no admission fee to enter this Buddhist temple. However, donations are highly requested.

Showcasing a unique mix of Thai and Chinese architecture, this 17-story pink tower features a giant green dragon encircling the entire temple. The paint colors have faded over the years, but doesn’t take away from how truly stunning it is. 

The dragon’s body is hollow and is essentially a winding tunnel. For a small donation, you can walk up the length of the dragon, all the way up to the rooftop. 

The dragon wrapped around the tower from bottom to the top symbolizes the “ascent to enlightenment - from sorrow to happiness and from hell to heaven.”

An elevator is available if climbing up a dragon’s body isn’t your cup of tea. However, a donation of 10 THB per person is requested.

Footwear must be removed prior to entering the temple, so come prepared with socks. Despite fans spread throughout the tunnel, it was still blazing hot. 

Since this is an active temple, monks were to be expected. However, I didn’t expect female monks! ALL of the monks we encountered as we walked through the temple grounds were female. 

I had donned a light cardigan to adhere to the temple’s dress code, but it seemed like they weren’t too strict about it. Several female visitors had exposed shoulders and were still able to enter the temple. 

Larger than life pictures of the past and present King and Queen of Thailand are displayed prominently near the temple’s entrance. Please note, it is a crime to speak disrespectfully of the Thai Royal family and is punishable with jail time.

We start by feeding the elephants - wow they are such amazing animals so gentle and so much personality. It is amazing to watch them eat with their trunks - they use their trunks for everything!! Then we walk with them over to the pond and get in the water and bath them (this is when you get wet!!) It is a really great experience. I am not sure it would be the same with a large group… We interact with three elephants - each has his own person accompanying them. When we are done, we head back and change back into our clothes and have the most delicious breakfast — omelet made with the freshest eggs and Pad Thai simple but delicious one of our best meals thus far on our trip… We drive back to Chang Mai… A truly memorable experience…",0,0,P03013199,Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya,joy,962486496.0

During Ayutthaya period, Somdet Phra Maha Chakkraphat (The King) reigned the kingdom and had Somdet Phra Sri Suriyothai as his wife. The Burmese army surrounded Ayutthaya by using the invasion route via the Three Pagodas Pass from Kanchanaburi to the west, and then to the capital Ayutthaya. The King  mounted his war elephant in preparation for battle. Somdet Phra Sri Suriyothai (the Queen) was so worried that she dressed in military attire and followed them on a war elephant. When the Ayutthaya army had faced the vanguard of the Burmese army , Somdet Phra Maha Chakkraphat (The King) engaged the enemy  but the elephant charged away from the enemy. Somdet Phra Sri Suriyothai, therefore, charged ahead between the King and the Viceroy to block his pursuit and was fatally injured. Whenever the Burmese saw that it was a lady killed in battle they stopped.

This is an out of the way place, not far from Lamai but very much off the beaten track - even our local driver had never been and required GPS navigation to get there.
The road leading to the waterfall is very rough. Most drivers/cabs would not go down this road, thankfully our driver was really nice and was driving a modern 4x4 so he pretty much took us as far as you can by car/scooter.
Make sure you have no knee problems cos it's pretty steep and it can get very slippery when going through the forest to access the waterfall. When you get there you are greeted with 3 levels of waterfall. They aren't huge by any means but they are lovely to look at. When we got there there was only one other person taking pictures.

The largest reclining Buddha in Thailand is enshrined here.
 The main attraction of this sacred temple is the white reclining 50 meters long Buddha statue (Luang Phor Khao). The image was built at the Sukhothai era (7 centuries ago). The image of the reclining Buddha represents the entry of Buddha into Nirvana and the end of All reincarnations.
According to the legend, Khun Inthapramun was a royal tax collector and he used some of the tax for building a sacred object. Being discovered that, he was sentenced to death and his remains buried there. And temple was called Wat Khun Inthapramun.
We drove (about 15 km) from Wat Muang to Wat Khun Inthapramun. The navigation was somehow difficult and the navigating programs were not enough for finding the temple. So we asked the locals for the proper route, which was leading to the Wat. 
Currently the reclining Buddha is staying outdoor, it's not within the temple, since the original temple has been destroyed for a long time, Only the ruins of the pillars have remained.

The instructors, especially Meichi Saree, are helpful and deeply compassionate. Phra Ajahn Suphan, the abbot and head teacher, has been at the monastery since he was 15 (35+ years ago) and is a kind and patient teacher.

I will say that if you're looking for a place that is extremely strict and serious, this is not it. They tell you not to talk and put signs up, but people do and nobody stops them. If you want to have a fruitful practice, refuse the urge to socialize at all, or even to make eye contact! It seems pleasant, but just gives the mind something to latch onto.

If you like farm animals and religious forms of relaxing then this place is somewhere you should visit. Near the temple there is all different stores for example 7-eleven. Or just standard stores that is all around Thailand. Another interesting part of the temple is an enormous statue of Buddha.

This architectural gem, dating back to the early 19th century, is not only a place of worship but also a symbol of cultural diversity and harmony within the fabric of Thai society.

The Ton Son Mosque, also known as Masjid Ton Son or Ton Son Islamic Center, has a history dating back over a century. Built in 1849 during the reign of King Rama III, it stands as one of the oldest mosques in Bangkok. Its construction was initiated by Haji Sulong, a prominent Muslim merchant of the time, and it has since served as a focal point for the Muslim community in the area.

One of the most striking features of the Ton Son Mosque is its unique architectural style, which blends traditional Thai design elements with Islamic motifs. The mosque's façade is adorned with intricate carvings and colorful tiles, reflecting the artistic fusion of Thai and Islamic influences. Its minaret, crowned with a golden dome, stands tall against the Bangkok skyline, offering a picturesque sight that captures the essence of Islamic architecture.

In a city teeming with cultural wonders, the Ton Son Mosque stands as a testament to Thailand's rich multicultural heritage. Its timeless beauty, rich history, and vibrant community make it a must-visit destination for anyone seeking to explore the diverse tapestry of Bangkok's cultural landscape. Whether you're a devout Muslim, a history enthusiast, or simply a curious traveler, a visit to the Ton Son Mosque promises an unforgettable experience that celebrates the unity in diversity that defines Thailand's cultural identity.

I went a friend by scooter, but it's both hot and dangerous. (Thai roads are not for beginners on scooters.) The tallest Buddha statue in gold can only be described as something worth seeing. It's not a mainstream tourist venue because of its remote location, and the fact that most tourists don't get to tour in Ang Thong province. If it were located near Bangkok it would be on every tour guides list of compulsory trips.

For me what was more impressive was the temples in the grounds of the Big Buddha statue. They are stunning. I've been to 50 temples or more, but these are in the top 10. One is hung wall to wall with artworks of incredible detail and high interest for scholars of Thailand history. They depict so much of Thai folklore and culture. Another is mirrored in and out, and simply breathtaking.
Of course there is much variety of food available, and shady places to sit and enjoy. Souvenir shops show off local wares, as well as the ""normal junk"". Something for everyone. If you have an extended stay, or if you've been to all the usual top 10 sites in Thailand, then this should be added to your list.
Nearby is another almost totally unknown temple which you can ask your driver to take you to, which will make it a full day trip out of Ang Thong town. It's called the Wat Ta It.

(1) the biggest Buddha image in Thailand, standing at 90 metres including its platform and dominating the surrounding pancake-flat countryside, and
(2) the life-size dioramas in its grounds.

On the trip out, Jannis ran through the equipment, hand signals and gave us a brief on the 2 dives we would do in a very clear and consise manner putting our nerves at ease.

The first dive got us used to the equipment, ran through some basic skills and techniques before letting us marvel at the reefs below Sail rock and all the aquatic life around it. Jannis matched the pace of the dive with our confidence which grew throughout the experience.

We then broke for lunch which was incredible (big thanks to the boat crew for looking after us so well)

The second dive, after checks, took us around sail rock which was magnificent. There were fish everywhere, above us, below us and even within touching distance (No touching allowed!). Jannis was slightly above us keeping us in check but we were basically on just a couples dive in awe of everything.

This review is pertintent first to the independent traveller; second to one that wants a day excursion outside Chiang Mai; and third to any one wishing to avoid the crowds that populate Wats like Doi Suthep and Chedi Luang. 

Do this trip for the rural scenery and for a much different Wat experience. You can do this trip by car, motorbike or songthaews. Bicycling is not a reasonable day trip and as tough a climb as Wat Doi Suthep. 

Expect to take about 3-4 hours roundtrip to the Wat or more if you take a wrong turn.  Aim your vehicle north to Mae Rim, then start looking for signs on the left directing you to turn west (a Buddha footprint is most helpful when seen). Info from travelfish.org states 5km to the sign but just where to begin counting that is very uncertain. I must have started too late as we drove only 2km.  Follow signs and Buddha footprints for 25 km, but don't miss a left hand turn at about 12-13 km where we saw neither footprints or the English temple's name.  We were trying at that point without GPS because it failed over and over to recognise the Wat until we ran words together. That is to say we missed this turn; GPS or a very detailed map is mandatory and a time saver. 

Otherwise enjoy the rural Thai countryside and observe Thai lifestyle. This is rural mountain driving and passing other vehicles is always ""interesting"" even with concrete road all the way. You have arrived when you pass through a huge concrete gate where upon you can view the smaller temples first or continue driving 300+ meters to the main attraction.  Don't forget that the viewable Buddha footprint is in a lesser temple. 

If you want to be off the beaten path this trip provides that and a lot more.

While most spas use lavender and rose oils, here they have massage treatments that use almond oil, macadamia oil and coconut oil which is really intriguing for someone with very dry skin such as myself. As this was my first time, I went for one of their more basic packages which involves a 60-minute almond oil massage and a 30-minute warm organic coconut oil massage where they combed the hot coconut oil into my roots gently and then massaged it into my scalp before masking it in a shower cap during the body massage. The almond oil was very moisturising and the tension was just right, I fell asleep at some intervals. There was a lot of stroking with palms and kneading which was an interesting change from the standard Thai massage most are used to. The service is also very friendly, I had a cough and the therapist got me some warm water mid-way. The only down side I see so far is that because it is a boutique spa, they don't have many facilities and I love steam rooms.

After being forced to take a tour, you get to hear all these positive messages about the symbolism such as respect your elders, take care of the environment, be kind to animals, and take care of your family, country, and community. Of course, good messages, but actions speak louder than words or symbols.
 You pass the shrine to Mother Earth and are told 'we all must do our part', only to walk outside to the sea and discover a mile+ long by 10meter wide floating pile of plastic and garbage in the seaside. (If they spent only a fraction less effort in paying low income laborers to clean up the sea opposed to hand chiselling shrines to Mother Earth Godesses out of Old Growth trees, that seaside would be cleaner and the message would be more than idillic words.). Not to mention supplying pottable drinking water to the people and saving millions of plastic water bottles from polluting the whole country side and ocean. 
Then you see the carving of a man rescuing a dog from a torrentially flowing river and you remember the 100's if not 1000's of stray/ferral dogs and cats sleeping on roads and dying alone of disease etc. I wont even go into the elephant riding situation found here. A sacred animal used to hold obese western tourists and walk in cicrcles in the summer heat on pavement.
Then you hear the great messages about taking care of your children and Family and then recall the girls selling themselves on Beach Road and being sold to 50+ year old white men for 'ping pong' shows. Who's children are these teenagers and where is the modo from the sanctuary in action. 
Back to 'Mother Earth' and the shrine to her. The irony here is massive but may be overlooked by the great carpentry. Up north I got to see the last lone male Gibbon in an entire region. A population destined for extirpation and possibly exiction; habitat loss and human influence would be top reasons. Here, you have a shrine to Mother Earth made out of old growth tropical hardwoods (aka gibbon habitat amongst other species such as Tigers).
Then you think, maybe this place would be nice to meditate in. But I am unsure when they will ever allow few enough people to allow for the same kind of spiritual awakening one can already find in nature such as the old Gibbon habitats and clean shores of days gone by.
This place is another tourist trap. Will make a ton of money, but not sure how many more dogs it will save, how much more in touch people will become with nature, or how many more teenage women will get engineering degrees instead of Master's Degrees in Ping-Pong shows?

Some of these ‘idyllic’ shots can cause over reaction in our judgement and increase anticipation. The result can be that when we actually see the object with our own eyes, the ‘real’ sight does not live up to the perceived images or our embroidered expectations.

Whilst I have been wanting to visit Thung Bua Tong Fields at Doi Mae U Kho, I was slightly concerned that this maybe a case of over expectation but was jubilant to discover that, in reality, this spectacular sight was much more that I had ever anticipated. It has left deep impressions.

From Khun Yuam on Route 108 turn up further into the mountains on route 1263 it’s a good road that twists and climbs for about 25kms. Finally, at an altitude of 1,600 meters one starts to see the yellow hillside and shortly one is surrounded by the masses of bright yellow ‘Sunflowers’.

Commonly known as the Tree Marigold the plants are from the family Asteraceae and also called Mexican Sunflowers and Nitobe chrysanthemum, amongst others. Whether they are true sunflowers or not is irrelevant as one leaves the car and is enveloped by this cornucopia of 2-meter+ tall swaying bushes of yellow delight.

The development here is quite tasteful. Yes, there is a winding road that passes through these fields, but traffic is minimal and respectful. There are a variety of trails that one can explore through the tunnels of flowers. Conveniently placed view-points afford magnificent vistas over the flowers to the surrounding mountains. Whilst there are toilets there are no commercial shops or cafes to disturb the scenery or clear alpine air.

The flowers bloom at their best sometime between the beginning of November until the second week of December. We visited on November 16th and I believe that the conditions could not have been better. One is recommended to visit either early morning or late afternoon (as we did), to enjoy the best views. It really is breath-taking, awe-inspiring, almost surreal, hypnotic and even spiritual as one attempts to absorb all that one is seeing within an aura of quietness and respect from the other visitors. 

It is a photographer’s dream, and one could probably spend 24 hours there to take in both the sunrise and the sunset. I believe that it is possible to camp, and a simple mountain resort is relatively nearby but apologies, I did not get the name 

For me it was one of the most inspirational sights that I have had the privilege to witness. I have heard it likened to the alpine meadows from the Sound of Music, but this does not do the Bua Tong Sunflower Fields justice. They are magical and we were truly so fortunate to visit when we did with the flowers in full bloom, spectacular panoramas over the mountains, a clear blue sky and few other visitors. Add this to your bucket list, no lifetime is complete without this experience.

Be careful when you visit, it would be so disappointing to arrive before the flowers are in bloom or when they are well past their best.

More often than not I find them a bit too crowded and sometimes also a bit exaggerated (at least to my somewhat austere taste). This place is different, however. Two colours stand out: brown/chestnut and gold and lend an air of calm, quiet and solemnity to the scene once you come into the temple. It had the effect on me, that I actually sat down and tried to meditate for a little while. This place is actually a soothing place to stay, and I had willingly stayed longer, had I not had obligations to the rest of my party to attend to. 
There's a good place to refresh yourself close by (Ban Suan Nim Ram) with reasonably priced food, and cottages too, if you want to stay in the area for longer. The scenery is also quite amazing. You find it all about an hours drive from Chantaburi .",2,2,P03004044,Saraburi,joy,541075404.0

This is the second of two caves along the headland both have rather unusal shrines in them. However this is larger of the two caves, as result has more contents inside it.

There was a bit of confusion and no clear information about the names of the Cave. For the purposes of this review, this one is Phra Nang Cave and the smaller one is Princess Cave.

Having visited the smaller cave first we were neither surprised nor shocked to see the contents of this Cave and it's shrine.

A statue of Phra Nang sits on a table, with legs crossed, holding  a bowl in front of her. The Shrine is surrounded by colourful floral tributes and pieces of cloth. There are two smaller statues perched behind Phra Nang, one on either side of her.

Around the cave there are vast numbers of wooden phalluses, erect penises, in all shapes and sizes and painted in different colours and embedded in the sand. There is a pile, towards the rear of the Cave of discarded phalluses. 

The Cave is a sacred place and should be treated with respect by visitors. Fishermen and boatmen come here  to make floral  offerings and burn incense ensuring a safe return journey from sea.

There is a sign requesting that visitors do not leave the following five items for Phra Nang as  ""she is Indian, not a God and she believes in the phallus or Ungam as a symbol of the Hindu God Shiva"".

The items are sex toys, red water, red flowers, traditional Thai costumes or strange offerings.

There are many legend and myths about who Phra Nang was, one is she was an Indian princess who was killed in a shipwreck nearby and her ghost occupies the cave.

Another story says that Phra Nang was the wife of a local fisherman, whose husband was lost at sea and she lived her life in the cave waiting for his return. 

Fishermen and boatmen still make offerings in the form of incense and flowers to ensure a safe journey. They believe that Phra Nang, Princess Goddess lives in the Cave under the cliff

We had a ten minutes break from the hike up before we entered the cave. The interior of the cave itself was superb. Some parts were slippery, others were just small openings we had to squeeze through. It was a tough climb up to the cave and a challenging one inside, so honestly, I was not fully able to enjoy the wonders of the cave.

Total ascent time took about 2.5 hours at a slow pace with regular stops and descent was 2 hours. I'd say difficulty level is only 3 out of 5 (as an experienced hiker), with the first 75% a gentle slope but lots of crossing through the steams (you will get wet up to knee or waist height) and the final 25% quite a steep ascent, often needing to use your hands. Care needs to be taken as the path gets wet and can be quite slippery.

One attraction here is the pink, champagne mushrooms (poisonous) which are quite beautiful. Then it's kwok e-dok waterfall itself which is quite a magnificent site but also fun to play in the pools (but a bit cold). Do take care as this is still quite a natural and undisturbed attraction. There are only a few ropes in a few places and the rest you'll have to hold on to bamboo or rock faces.

We were dropped off at the Ton Sai side and hiked the 5 miles to the other side. We asked for a guide on arrival and were offered it at a cost of 500THB each (after also paying the 200THB per adult and 100THB per child) but we negotiated it to 1,500THB. It took us somewhere just under 3 hours and we were glad we had a lot of water with us. I wouldn’t say it was a very challenging hike so long as you are reasonably fit but the heat and humidity does add difficulty. There were some parts that were very steep and some parts which were quite tricky to navigate. We certainly would have struggled to find our way without a guide but I would describe him as sat nav more than a guide. He didn’t point anything out to us or assist with navigating tricky parts of the path. Both of my parents fell (65yo and 75yo) at separate points and he didn’t come to their assistance at all. 
We saw one small snake on the path and some butterflies…no other wildlife. I would recommend this hike if you particularly like hiking through jungle but there’s not much else on offer so far as sights. If you want the sights then visit the Bang Pae side and visit the waterfall there. It takes about ten minutes to get to it from the car park.

The first day was quite enjoyable. We saw many animals, and the day was exciting. Deaw seemed to be a good guide.

In the afternoon, we embarked on a ""night safari,"" which involved riding in the back of a car with a person who used a flashlight to point at trees, ostensibly to spot animals. However, the car moved quite quickly, making it doubtful how effective the flashlight was at such speeds. Then, it started raining heavily. I asked the staff to stop, but they did not. When the rain ceased and we started to enjoy the ""night safari"" again, we returned to the pickup point 15 minutes before the activity was scheduled to end. I wonder why...

On the morning of the second day, we discovered that Deaw had decided to start a tour with another group. It seemed he wanted to optimize his earnings and therefore assigned us another guide. Initially, we regretted not being with Deaw, as we had become familiar with him. However, we understood the situation and decided to give the new guide a chance.

The trek itself was enjoyable but lasted only about 1 hour and 30 minutes. The guide mentioned we were walking quite fast and had us lead the group instead of guiding us himself. By 12:00 PM, we had arrived at the central part of the park. We asked the guide about additional activities we could do until lunchtime, but he responded with, ""I don't know."" When we mentioned we had paid for a private tour and expected a private guide, he seemed surprised, asking, ""You paid me?!""

At that point, we learned that the guide would leave us, and we would spend the rest of the day on our own, receiving only transfers between locations. This was completely disappointing. We ended up doing activities we could have done independently by renting a motorcycle, without any guidance or explanations. Essentially, we visited several unremarkable waterfalls with no added value.

Deaw, when offering a private tour, there should be a minimum standard of service. Unfortunately, the second day fell short of our expectations. While we were satisfied with the first day of the tour, the second day was the opposite.

Additionally, one of the reasons we booked this tour was because of the activities listed on your website, many of which did not take place. It seems you cannot trust what the website advertises.

I understand that others might have enjoyed this tour, but the uncertainty of what Deaw feels like doing with your tour is not worth the price.

For all these reasons, I would not recommend this tour.",0,0,P03004741,Nakhon Nayok,joy,963363393.0

I wanted to describe how to get there because the directions I saw on line were poor. If you are in Patong go south on hi-way 4030. It's just the main road out of the city.

At the entrance will be taxis and rides up there. You can take your scooter or whatever you have and do the drive yourself. 

The road is pretty bad in many spots but not terrible. After roughly a kilometer there will be a bend in the road to the left and going straight is the decent to Nui beach. This is where I park my scooter. Take the bend left and it's about 500 meters a little uphill not too steep. You will come to a black rock that says Pa Hin Dum.

The opposite side of the road is another sign, in Thai, that has an arrow pointing up a trail. There is also a worn, faded very faded flag. Take this trail. It's about 200 meters and pretty built up with some railing and a rest spot at one point. Soon you will reach the top and see an incredible view.

This epic poem which has its roots in Thai folklore, is one of the most important works in Thai literature.

Every schoolchild in Thailand learns passages from the poem, and it is the source of many songs, popular sayings and metaphors.

Whilst they have plastic tarpaulins you are fairly low to the water and always face the possibility of getting wet from the spray.

The other alternative is the tourist hop on/hop off boats which run from Pratunam (bear the Central World Plaza) and Panfa Leelard, just behind the Mahakan Fort, at Phanfa Bridge.

Don't expect the boat to pull gently up to the pier to allow people to embark or disembark. That's not its style. Instead, the kamikaze pilot at the helm zips along the canal at full throttle. At the last possible second, he throws the engine in reverse and careens into the pier. As the engine screams and fills the air with diesel smoke, passengers scramble on and off, desperately trying not to get crushed between the boat and the dock, or worse, fall into the canal. 

A kid wearing a crash helmet clambers around the outside of the boat, pulling himself along by a couple ropes while he sells tickets to the passengers who've hopped aboard. In the past, the deckhand didn't have to wear a helmet. But then the boat operators decided to get serious about safety. 

I decide to take the Khlong Saen Saep Express Boat out to Witthayu Road because unless you have a helicopter it's definitely the fastest way to get across town. As we pick up speed, a local guy sitting in front of me pulls up the plastic tarp that's supposed to protect us from the spray. An American tourist sitting next to him notices.

3105,1368429.0,Mae Hong Son Loop,Solo travel,5.0,8.0,"The Mae Hong Son Loop is a beautiful route in Northern Thailand.
Popular amongst bikers and tourists because of the amazing roads with stunning viewpoints.

I can't even tell how many times I did the loop, probably about 7+ times,and I would do it all over again. And again.
It's the feeling of freedom to wander where you want, on not such a strict schedule.

Is it dangerous, some ask.
Be responsible while driving, stay in your own lane and watch out for oncoming traffic, because sometimes they might be on your side of the road.
How about the curves?
Some of them are hairpin curves which can be quite steep.
How to know if you are able to ride such a curve?
As an example you could take a trip to Wat Phra That Doi Suthep in Chiang Mai. Just before arriving to the 300 steps stairs, there is a hairpin curve with some steepness to it. Now you can determine yourself if you are able to conquer this curve and the curves along the Mae Hong Son Loop.

Back to the Mae Hong Son Loop with some tips, do's and don'ts.
When it comes to clockwise or counter clockwise direction, there is no right or wrong. However, I prefer clockwise because it seems in this direction the loop gets only better and better.
For this ride you might need 5/6 days. No rush, take it easy and enjoy every moment.

After a few days sightseeing in Chiang Mai, it's time to start the loop.
Make sure you have a (big) bike with at least 155cc.
My favourite ride is a Yamaha Aerox 155cc.
This is an automatic bike which has enough power to get you through the loop.
Leave some luggage behind in your Chiang Mai hotel if you have too much.
During the loop comfort is essential, so have a lightweight backpack on and leave some space for groceries on the way.
Always pack a raincoat (or 2, two bottles of water and a jacket. A jacket? Yes, it can be cold up there in the mountains!

Leave Chiang Mai City when it starts to get light outside. There is a long drive ahead. Follow road 108 for 63km and turn right into road 1009 to Doi Inthanon National Park. From road 1009 to the summit is about 50km.
This park is famous for it’s highest point of Thailand, waterfalls, the 2 pagoda’s and it’s garden. At the entrance of the national park you pay an entrance fee for yourself and your bike.
Personally I have 3 stops in this park. The first one is the Wachirathan Waterfall. This is 80m high waterfall and the biggest in this park.
The next stop are the 2 pagoda’s. It’s easy to miss while you drive, so keep your eyes open. You’ll see some parkingspots on the left side of the road with a steep road between them, which is the entrance.
Park your bike and start walking up the steep road, or get the shuttle if available. The 2 pagoda’s honor the late king and queen of Thailand.
These pagoda’s are stunning, surrounded by a beautiful garden and amazing views if the weather is good.
Now the last stop is the highest point of Thailand, which is only 6km away from the pagoda’s. Now the anti climax is that the highest point of Thailand is surrounded by trees, so not much of a view.
Some people like to arrange accomodation in or near the park to enjoy the sunrise which they view from a once of the turns or from the pagoda’s.
It’s time to hit the road and leave the National Park.
Going back to road 108 and follow this road for 135km to Mae Sariang.
Mae Sariang is a city not far from Myanmar.
There is not much to see in this city, but rest is needed since the drive was about 290km in total.
A recommended hotel is Above The Sea Boutique hotel. There is not much
choice when it comes to hotels, but this is the best one. It has rooms in loft style and one of the softest beds I’ve ever tried.
Drop your stuff in the room, have a shower and go for a Khao Soi,
a famous soup in the northern part of Thailand.
After a ride like today and a nice meal, you sure need a good rest.

The second day of the loop is also recommended to leave after breakfast,
Above The Sea Boutique Hotel offers you different options of breakfast.
The drive will be continued on road 108 for 165km to Mae Hong Son.
This doesn’t seem far, but there are many curves tob e conquered.
From Mae Sariang to Mae Hong Son you will see some changes in nature
and here and there some viewpoints will popup.
Get off your bike, grab a drink and enjoy some of the views you see a long the way. Have a stop at these viewpoints such as Mae La Luang Viewpoint with it’s soft rounded hills or Pha Bong Viewpoint with it’s view of huge mountains.
After 165km you arrive in Mae Hong Son City.
My recommended hotel is B2 Mae Hong Son Premier Resort.
This hotel is not far away from the center, but it’s located at a quiet spot.
It’s a good idea to stay here for 2 nights.
Wake up early the next day, very early. Grab the bike, buy some coffee and a bite at 7-11 and hit road 1095 for about 15km, where you then turn left into road 4001 for 25km until you arrive at the Pang Oung Lake. This is a beautiful lake, which is a project of the late King Bhumibol to restore forests and ecosystems. And if you are early enough, you can see the fog floating on the water. Sit down and enjoy the view with your breakfast you bought at 7-11.
Continue on road 4001 for 13km and you will arrive at Ban Rak Thai.
This is a village not far from the Myanmar border built in Yunnanese style.
In the middle of the village there is a lake, which also has the morning fog
over the water. You may want to choose where you want to enjoy the
morning fog, in Pang Oung Lake or Ban Rak Thai.
It’s only viewable in the morning for a short period of time.
By the time you arrive at the second destination, there won’t be morning fog to be seen anymore.
Be careful, because the road to these 2 destinations is very steep and has a
lot of curves.
From Ban Rak Thai on road 4001 going back for 28km, going back on road 1095 (which becomes road 108) for 20km, you arrive at a temple on a mountain called Wat Phra That Doi Kongmu.
This temple shows you a great view of the city of Mae Hong Son.
You can even see the airport from here.
There is a coffeeshop located next to the temple, have a seat, have a drink and enjoy the view.
When you’re on the way back to the hotel, stop by the Cafe Station or MHS Chamber of Commerce. At both of these places you’ll be able to get yourself a certificate for doing the Mae Hong Son Loop. A very nice souvenir!
After you have returned in your hotel and enjoyed a nice shower,
it is recommended to get out in the evening and visit the lake in the city center, named Chong Kham.
This lake is surrounded by a temple, named Wat Chong Kham and a night market. Time for a nice dinner next to the lake with a view of the temple.
After such a day full of activities, it’s time to hit the sheets.

The next day awaits a trip to the city of Pai. Follow road 108/1095 for 105km.
This route has countless curves. Be careful, but enjoy it!
You will pass a bamboo bridge named Su Tong Pae Bridge after 12km on the road. This bridge is meant for monks, so they wouldn’t have to walk in the rice fields. After 10km on the road you will arrive at the fish cave, named Tham Pla.
Personally I am not into caves so I rather move on.
Along the way on road 1095 you arrive at the Pang Mapha viewpoint.
Beautiful view, if the weather allows it, and some stalls around for a drink and
a small bite. From this viewpoint it’s about 10km on road 1095 turning into 1226 going to Ban Jabo, if you are interested.
This is a Lahu tribe village with some beautiful views.
Another viewpoint along the main road is Doi Kiew Lom Viewpoint.
This is the viewpoint which has a view from both sides of the road,
there is a giant swing and ofcourse some stalls around for your appetite.
So after in total 105km you arrive in Pai. It will probably be late in the afternoon.
My recommended hotel in Pai is the Ai Pai Hotel.
It’s one of the most expensive hotels in Pai, but has amazing beds and is
around the corner of the famous walking street.
It’s recommended to stay for 2 nights, so you have a whole day to spend
in Pai.
Have a refreshing shower and head into the walking street. From the Ai Pai Hotel it’s less than 30 seconds and you’ll be in the walking street.
There is a very laid back vibe and so much to see..and eat.
The next morning it’s time to grab the bike and drive 5km on road 1095 and head out to the Big White Buddha. Park your bike and have a morning workout walking up the stairs to the Buddha. Don’t forget a bottle of water, you’ll need it! Once up there, you’ll have a view of the city, if there isn’t too much fog.
4km away on road 1095 and you arrive at the Pai Canyon.
Park your bike next to the road and have a walk up Pai Canyon.
It has some beautiful views, but try not to be there midday, because it can be hot. Some people like to enjoy the sunset at that spot.
There is also another good spot to enjoy the sunset while having a bite and a drink, which is Two Huts Pai. From the White Buddha it’s only 6km away.
After sunset the walking street is waiting for the evening meal.

The next day is the last day of the Mae Hong Son Loop.The route goes on road 1095/107 from Pai back to Chiang Mai.
Don’t forget to take a picture or selfie at the “I AM PAI” sign.
You’ll pass the Pai Canyon again on the way back, and just after the Pai Canyon you will see the Tha Pai Memorial Bridge. In the past this bridge was used to bring trees from the jungle to Pai.
In 1944 the Japanese Army burned down the bridge and at the end of the war it was rebuilt.
Along the curvy road you will pass a viewpoint named Rak Chang.
Not much of a view, but there is a coffeeshop, and you might need a refreshment during conquering this road.
60km away from Chiang Mai there is a small waterfall named Mok Fa.
It’s not too big, but it’s on the road to our destination, so why not.
Back on the road you will notice that traffic increases, trafficjams, shoppingmalls, noise, tourists…and after about 700km, 5 nights and 6 days you’re back in Chiang Mai.

Now this is just an example how to do the Mae Hong Son Loop.
You could do it counter clockwise, stay for more or less nights, have more or less stops; it’s all up to you.
One thing is guaranteed when you do this loop, you’ll experience freedom and Thai hospitality.
Oh, and don’t forget wear a helmet!

The scenic route takes you through stunning mountain landscapes, quaint villages, and picturesque temples. As you wind your way through the lush greenery, you can't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder at the natural beauty that surrounds you.

One of the highlights of the trip is the opportunity to visit local hill tribes and learn about their culture and way of life. The people are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and it's a great chance to gain a deeper appreciation for the diversity of Thailand.

The roads themselves are a bit challenging at times, with steep inclines and hairpin turns, but they're well worth the effort. The feeling of freedom and exhilaration as you navigate the winding roads is indescribable.

Along the way, there are plenty of places to stop and take in the stunning views, enjoy a delicious meal, or relax at a hot spring. Each stop offers its own unique charm, and it's hard to pick a favorite.

Overall, riding the Mae Hong Son Loop is an incredible adventure that should be on every traveler's bucket list. It's an opportunity to experience the beauty and culture of Thailand in a way that few other experiences can match. Highly recommended!

We paid all in cash before we got the clothing. In hindsight it was super naive of us, it was literally our first day in Bangkok and we had no idea what we were doing! We just got back to our hotel after ordering the clothing about 12 days ago (we leave tomorrow) and our items were delivered as promised on the day promised, with very nice bags with nice wooden hangers. They added in a pashmina for me and two ties, pocket squares, and cuff links for my husband which they said they would. Every single item fits both of us perfectly. I have absolutely no regrets or complaints! I’m not sure how the tailor gets such bad reviews if everyone gets this quality, but we did not receive anything poorly fitted or made. If this fabric is not cashmere I honestly cannot tell the difference so I don’t really care, it’s super soft and fits me so well. We don’t have anything at home that fits this nicely. We are so happy and 100% satisfied. Maybe the store is hit or miss,or maybe if you go during high season they are over-run with orders and cannot pay adequate attention to each item, I’m not really sure how others have such bad experiences. The mode of getting you there does seem sketchy after you read so many stories, but after seeing this great quality I’m thinking perhaps that’s just how business is done in Eastern cultures and I cannot begrudge anyone for making a commission differently than we do.

But I will admit that doing it the second day that you’re in Bangkok when you’re still jet lagged and don’t know your way around and have limited stamina might not have been the best plan.

We were advised to book a hop on, hop off boat for the day.  It was not a bad plan, and at 140 or 150 BHT per person, it wasn’t that expensive, but I think that one way tickets were 30 BHT per ride, and unless you are very disciplined and fast, you are not likely to be able to tour five different stops in a day.  As it was, we decided that we would go from the beginning of the boat dock to the terminus, then decide which stops we wanted to get off at on the way back.  We spent way too much time wandering the last stop, which really did not have a lot to see, but took a lot of time to figure that out.  So by the time we got around to seeing the Wat Arun and Wat Pho stops (same stop, but you need to take a 10 BHT ferry ride from Wat Arun to get across the river to Wat Pho), it was mid afternoon, and by the time we had seen both stops, we discovered that we had missed the last boat pick up to return.  We ended up walking from Wat Arun to the MRT which was doable, but added an element of uncertainty to a long hot day.

What to expect? This is still real wilderness, meaning: only camping facilities in the park, a very limited number of trails and only two view towers. Your wildlife viewing will mostly be done from the car or from one of the towers. Patience is key while you wait for something interesting to come out in the open. Therefore, we do not recommend this park for families with small kids (unless they like sitting still). We do recommend this park for real wildlife enthusiasts because in the three days we were there we saw plenty of wildlife (wild boar, several kinds of deer, gibbons, bats, banteng, civets, more birds than we can count, muntjak, jackals, ...). This park also gives you a very teeny tiny chance to see a tiger (we didn't though).
The wildlife is quite shy, once an animal spots you, it will show you immediately how fast it can run. If you want to take photos, a 300mm lens is a minimum for good shots.

How to get there? The area is quite remote and unless you feel like doing a bus hopping tour, get a guide who provides you with transportation.

Why take a guide and who to take? You will enjoy this park much more if you have someone with you to show you animals. Not many guides operate in this park but we were very happy with Tontan Travels. Doesn't matter what you see or hear, our guide Tony was able to find it and identify it. If we hadn't had him with us, we would have seen only a fraction of the animals we actually saw now. Also ask your guide for an after dark walk to see palm civets, wild boars, tokays, ... .

Where to stay and eat? You can stay outside the park but we thought the bungalows there were of poor value. Camping inside the camp is much more fun and gives you the opportunity to get up early to see animals. The ablution blocks were clean and quite ok when we were there (do not expect a warm shower). Just outside the park there is a little restaurant. We found the food average but it is your only option and you won't go hungry.

What to bring? your camera with telelens for the viewing towers and long pants for jungle walks. Ask your guide for leech socks, in the dry season you won't see leeches but there will be ticks and the socks will make it more difficult for them.

In a nutshell: if you enjoy spotting wildlife and don't mind being patient to see it...go to this park with a good guide and cross your fingers to see a tiger!",0,0,P03012832,Uthai Thani,sadness,253170519.0

Personally, I love to go to the beach. I need to visit at least one beach every year. And this place was really amazing. Food and drinks are not that expensive and also delicious as well.

The Northern Thailand landscapes are unparalleled.

I've heard some people complain about the price - it's really not bad cmon! Yes, locals have a lower price - but that reflects the salary ratio of what local Thais make. 

20 baht for locals (75 cents in US) vs. 200 baht for foreigners (around 6 USD). Like seriously?? Are you really going to complain about 6 dollars? the average monthly salary for an avg worker in Lampang is around 15,000 baht (500 dollars) so yeah, they are going to have a cheaper price. I know this because I lived in Lampang. Don't complain! 

THE thing to do in Chae Son is to boil eggs in the hot springs. It's an ""only in Thailand"" experience. Something about the temperature or the minerals makes the eggs boil from the inside out. So if you boil for 15 minutes, you will get an egg that has a soft-boiled yolk and a gelatinous (but cooked) egg white. It slides right out of the shell. Eat with soy sauce. Best egg you'll ever taste.

Aside from that history it is a very pretty wooden temple which is also the villages community center so you will see on any given day a slice of rural northern Thai culture going on at the temple also being located in a farming community where still to this day many of the fields are still planted and cultivated by hand offering a great photo opportunity so see the hand harvesting of rice fields by local families.

I spent about three hours total and saw everything I wanted to see except for a few out of the way temples in the far west of the larger park, which were guarded by enough stray dogs to make me nervous about getting out of the car.

The Phra Buddha Maha Thammaraja statue dates back to the Khmer era and it is probably of Khmer not Thai origin.

(None of the buildings at the site today seem to be more than about 100 years old, however). The statue made a real nuisance of itself by wandering out of the wat one night and bathing itself in the cool waters of the Pa Sak River, which is located just across the road from the temple. The locals brought it back to the temple but they now have an annual festivity in which the gilded idol is immersed once more in the waters of the Pa Sok River every year. 

The venerated image is perhaps more likely to appeal to Thais than foreigners. (Yet there was no Thais viewing it during our visit either).

Many young women played with their phones, not even looking up. About half way up there is a museum of tribal artifacts to view for 10 baht. The museum is actually a small enclosure the size of a one car garage. Exit through the back and you’re outside in front of a beautiful, massive, hillside garden of flowers and herbs. The concrete path continues through the garden up and up until you are very high above the village with a great view of the garden below. A little higher up and you enter a cafe with cold and hot drinks and coffee beans for purchase. There are also bathrooms if needed. Behind the Cafe is a thick jungle with exceptionally tall bamboo trees that make for great photos. Then you make your way back down the concrete path which brings you back into the gift stalls. If you’re physically able to maneuver through the stalls on the concrete path which is constantly going up and the footing can be a little tricky, then I recommend this outing for an original experience.",2,1,P03014171,Kamphaeng Phet,anger,832467614.0

The bridge links the human and heavenly realms of Buddhist and Hindu cosmology,

The entrance to the main temple is decorated with images of dancing Shiva. The entrance leads into a long narrow passage with architraves decorated with reliefs of scenes from Ramayana.Further in, the reliefs turn to Buddhist scenes. The main altar has an image of Buddha being sheltered by Naga. The mandapa above the Buddha has a high ceiling. It’s mainly on the exterior where there’s a lot of decoration, most prominently several giant reliefs of Garuda.

Phimai Historical Park is a fantastic day trip from Korat, especially if you like archaeology.",2,2,P03002237,Sukhothai,joy,954553129.0
3752,456512.0,Phimai Historical Park,Friends getaway,5.0,0.0,"Phimai Historical Park is a historical park in Thailand, covering the ancient town of Phimai and the ruins of Prasat Phimai, the largest ancient Khmer-Hindu temple in Thailand. It is located in the town of Phimai, Nakhon Ratchasima province. It is one of the most important tourist attractions in the province.

Most buildings are from the late 11th to the late 12th century, built in the Baphuon, Bayon and Khmer temple style. However, even though the Khmer at that time were Hindu, the temple was built as a Buddhist temple, since the inhabitants of the Khorat area had been Buddhists as far back as the 7th century. 

Didn't know a whole lot about this place before I arrived so was pleasantly surprised when I had the chance to see some real history in Korat. Entrance was a very reasonable 1 Euros 23 cents, a bargain, considering I spent well over two hours here, wandering around the ruins and taking in all the breathtaking temples, monuments, and ruins. 

There were not so many tourists as well, a few, but as the place is big enough everyone is well spaced out, which is great for taking some photos and for taking your time walking around.
There is plenty of areas for one to sit down and take a break, under a tree in out of the sun, or for a close up at the stone work involved in the building of the ruins.

The gardens and lawns, and the ruins themselves, are very well maintained and looked after, and there are toilets and bathrooms available, and a mini museum for people to learn more about the Khmer history of the area. 

For people who perhaps cant visit Angkor Wat, for whatever reason, this is a good Thai alternative (not that I have visited Angkor Wat - but it feels like it is!)

I spent 7 days there and it was no where near enough. 

Accomdation:
There are 2 camps and the accomdation differs.  I paid for a basic room and was in the yoga camp.  If I went back I would stay at the muay Thai boxing camp as the rooms are more modern and next to the pool.  However, although basic, they have everything you need and are cleaned every day.  You don't spent alot of time in your room. 

Trucks run from one camp to the other at certain times however outwith there are bikes to use.  I walked a few times and it isn't long just make sure you avoid the rain! 

Timetable: 
Packages vary however I had the full fitness and wellness package.  The only issue I had was trying to fit everything in !! There's loads of choice; muay thai is on twice per day and there are a number of different yoga options with something different every day.  The muay thai rainers are amazing, they make you work hard however have a laugh with you whilst doing it! The yoga teachers all have different styles but each one of them are so kind, friendly and knowledgeable and go above and beyond to support you.  This was amazing given I was totally new to yoga! There are trips also.  I didn't attend alot of them given my short stay. 

Food: 
The food was great.  Everything is prepared fresh each day.  You can request a raw breakfast/ dinner.  I had a raw breakfast every morning with a few eggs and it was so fresh and tasty. Breakfast and dinner is served however for lunch you help yourself to tuna, cheese, bread etc from the fridges  theses are located at both camps.

Last week I was in Bangkok to visit a good friend who had recently started living in the city as a digital nomad. I was keen to find somewhere that could provide a great massage both to untie some knots left over from the flight and to just relax and enjoy my holiday in general.

After some quick Trip Advisor and Google review research, Dahra Spa looked the part - close location (Silom Branch), extensive menu and great reviews. I booked myself in for an hour treatment, a Royal Thai massage.

On visiting, I was very impressed with the facilities and the service - the receptionist was very organised and welcoming, the waiting area was very comfortable and the overall vibe of the place was incredibly relaxing - no mean feet after you step off the busy streets of Bangkok in Silom.

I was asked if I had areas I wanted to focus on, areas I wanted to avoid, medical conditions, pressure levels etc - it was a very thorough and professional experience.

The massage itself was excellent - the first part was very relaxing and targeted to the areas I wanted to focus on, so lots of tension in my upper back, shoulders, neck etc (typical desk worker). Pressure was great and the therapist regularly checked in to see how everything was feeling.

The second part was very much the Thai Massage experience, with a lot of manipulation into different positions, stretching and massage. It can seem a bit intimidating at first, but the reason it works so well at Dahra is they clearly know exactly what they were doing - where I was stretched, moved and massages, everything was done within my limits and without causing any pain or discomfort.

I walked away feeling lighter and more comfortable than I had felt in a long time - an absolutely wonderful experience. I cannot recommend Dahra Spa enough. Prior to flying out of Thailand, I booked a second massage, and it was every bit as good as the first.",0,0,P03025466,Bangkok,joy,877340564.0

They love what they do and you can feel that through out the classes that they want us to love thai food and they teach us to cook like a thai!

We learnt to make common dishes such as Phad Thai, Satay, and curries.  But we made pretty much everything from scratch.  We made the curry paste with a mortar.  We tasted the curry paste as we made it, so we know what flavor we are aiming for.  We had the recipes but what JC always tried hard to teach us was what the ""flavor"" should be like because that is a better way to learn the dishes.  

We also learn to make some dishes that are not common in America.  We made many salads and seafood dishes that are commonly found in Asia and in more authentic thai restaurants.  Through cooking different dishes, we learnt about Thai cooking and Thai's way of  life.  It was just wonderful.

JC is a great instructor.  She will always take the time to answer our questions.  She taught us the components and complexities of thai food.  She introduced us to all the thai ingredients and how to achieve the balance of the sweetness, saltiness and spiciness in Thai food.

I was planning a recent trip to Bangkok and I decided to ask a friend that is a corporate chef for a major chain for reccomendations for a chef school in Bangkok. He reccomended Khao San. In looking at their website you will probably recognize several culinary figures here in the US and around the world that have attended the school. The school was founded by Kobkaew Najpinit and her daughter, Ning. Kobkaew is considered the godmother of Royal Thai cuisine. Kobkaew and Ning have been invited several times to lecture and present at the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone here in the US. They have consulted on several Thai cookbooks by some of the best known chefs of Thai cuisine. I was very excited to get the opportunity to learn Thai cooking at Khao San. 
The way the school is set up is you select 3 dishes that you would like to prepare. The ingredients necessary are assembled. Ning not only explains the ingredients and preparation techniques but also makes sure that she illustrates the history and cultural importance of the dish. Food is extremely important to the Thai culture. While Ning and her brother do an excellent job in the techniques of wok frying or grinding curry pastes, they particularly excel in explaining Thai culinary culture. Ning actually holds a masters degree in anthropology in addition to being a very good chef. The school is set up in the back of the D&D Inn on Khao San (or sarn) road. This area of Bangkok is kind of a funky, bohemian area of backpackers and hippies and worth a visit even if not attending the school. However, the school is very professionally equiped, light. airy and very clean. I know there are several more ""tourist"" oriented schools mass marketed in Bangkok, however if you want the same culinary training in Thai cusine that many of the most well known chefs around the world have gotten then I would reccomend the Khao San Cooking school.",1,1,P03013450,Bangkok,joy,104907583.0

The museum has some video presentations and exhibits covering the history of trade and of money. It is informative and not restricted to coins alone as the name might suggest.

The museum includes items from a pre-existing coin exhibition, now closed, that was previously located in the Grand Palace.

The only criticism I have is that the tour lasts only 1-1/2 hrs and is rushed. There is so much to see that an increase in length to 2 hours would seem appropriate. For example, there is one area with a set of coins of each denomination for a large number of the world’s countries, maybe all, didn’t catch how many. Children are encouraged to rush around stamping a souvenir booklet with images of the coins, which is fun, but adults don’t have time to look at every country’s exhibit. It is not allowed to circuit again to take in more of the exhibits without a guide. I suppose that’s for security reasons. Could have spent more time here.

Admission is free and the tours are free.

It’s important to note that the museum’s stated opening hours are 10am to 6pm (Tuesday to Sunday – closed Monday). But, because admission is by 1-1/2 hr guided tour, the effective closing time is 4.30pm, possibly earlier – the last guided tour may depart before 4.30pm!

Because it's a place where a variety of products are sold together in one place.  Feels like going to Chatuchak market but not crowded and not easily lost.  because it is clearly divided into zones  Both the pet zone, the tree zone, the food zone, the second-hand zone and various appliances.  There is also a park that is a garden groove as well.  For those who want to relax with family  or to exercise such as running  It's also appropriate.
 
  For traveling to Sanam Luang 2, this is mainly to drive a private car.  There are quite a lot of parking spaces here.  but never enough to stop  especially during Saturday and Sunday  There will be a lot of people.  Expenses can be viewed at the arrival point when receiving the card.  As for other forms of travel  It will be a bus like 2 rows (written on the sign saying go to Sanam Luang 2) that can go up at the beginning of the line at Bang Khae Market.

  1. Tree zone is the zone where I come to dwell the most with my passion for cactus.  So this area I will know quite a lot.  The main ones that are there will be cactus.  From the low price to the ten thousand foot pedal, there are some.  trees  that both bloom and bear fruit make us happy  vegetable garden  Decorative plants, orchids and other things, which if you are a person who likes plants, you must not miss this place.  They also sell pots of terracotta, plastic, garden equipment, ornamental stones, and other things necessary to grow plants.  It's all here.  This zone is in front of Sanam Luang Song.  near the entrance  and inserted at various points as well
 
  2. Pet Zone  Appealing animal lovers, including land animals, aquatic animals, and exotic animals here are also presented to choose from.  Although not as many as Chatuchak market  But here there are also pet supplies.  various animal feeds  that we don't have to poop to Chatuchak at all.
 
  3. The food zone is a zone that exists throughout Sanam Luang 2, whether it is a restaurant, canteen, selling food for takeout.  Famous places have popular egg snacks.  If you come here, don't miss out on buying them as souvenirs.  Other food  For example, there are shops like Kim Yong Market to open here as well.  The price might be a little expensive.  But if compared to not having to go down to carry at Hat Yai up, it's worth it.
 
  4. Second-hand sales zone  It is a zone that is located along with the front zone.  But this period is quite busy especially.  with a lot of salespeople flocking to sell  And the people who come to buy things will be clustered in this zone quite a lot.

I was supposed to camp up there for a night because of the rain and my flight schedule I changed my mind. The rain doesn't stop me. Those who know me, know that risks like these only increase my motivation to accomplish something. I did one day hike instead. You must have a guide to hike this mountain. The route is crazy! Thanks to my guide Tongchai Lungpong (you can find him in Facebook) preparing a pair of Phua Chu Kang boots for me. I don't think I can complete this route without one. I spent most of my energy shuffling in the nutella mud on my way up. I was lucky that the rain stops after 4 hours of hiking. The sun came up. Able to view the mountain goats from a distance and the most pleasant smelling flower such as pink lady and lavender. This is what I came for.

After having delicious TomYam maggi cooked by TongChai. We continue our journey of 'The Only Way is Up'. The view up on the top leave me undone. We decent around 2:30pm it gets real dark while losing grip while trying hard to glue on the track. Luckily we prepared head light and torch. It's pitch dark and we found a few fireflies wandering around the trees. Landed at 10pm that sums up 13 hours. Off we go for steamboat instead of hot spring.

I was spoken to like I am a DOG by the dentist! I am not exaggerating!  I am absolutely in shock! I have lived in Thailand nearly 20 years and this is the first time I have been spoken to (shouted at!) in this way by anyone. I am especially shocked it was from a health ""professional"".

I was polite and friendly (I am a quiet person). As soon as I entered the female dentist  gave me a disgusted look.

Eventually, after having her back to me for a long time she turned around and said loudly and sharply, ""WHAT DO YOU WANT?""
I was quite surprised but began to explain which is when she began shouting, repeating the same thing at me over and over.

I tried to explain that i was experiencing but she would not listen and continued to shout the same thing over and over! OMG, I had no words left. I just wanted to get out of there. I am too polite and regret not shouting back at her and telling her she has no right to speak to people like they are dogs!

I have been to CMU dental facility several times in the past and the staff are polite and many dentists are nice, but my recent experience has been SHOCKING and this dentist really should not be in the profession because she has NO IDEA HOW to speak to patients or people in general.

I am already a very nervous patient in a dentist facility and she has made the fear even worse! I am embarrassed to say I left the dental facility in tears because it was really a shock. I thought that by going to a private university dental practice, that I would be given accurate helpful information but I did not think that it would involve treating me like dirt.

I will now look for a different dental facility to help with my dental problem. A place where you are spoken to with a decent level of respect.

CMU, please could you send your dental staff for customer care training and teach them how to properly handle patients. This is NOT OK. We patients may be able to handle a little curtness, but not to be spoken to/shouted at like we are animals.",2,2,P03013832,Bangkok,anger,903570343.0

Nathon town itself isn’t not really on the tourist circuit, but it’s a good place for a stroll; blocks of old timber shop houses in various states of disrepair, one a green grocer, its neighbour a motorcycle repair shop, and so on.

Everything was super cheap. Drink options were pretty much Fanta or water. There are tables and stools to perch at while you eat.
After dinner, we walked to the end of the pier and enjoyed the sunset, and also paused to watch a group of tourists attempt disembarking a dinner cruise along an alarmingly narrow and unpredictably wobbly gang plank. Luckily, there were no casualties.

There is a 50bht entry fee at Viewpoint 1's entrance. The funds go towards maintaining the viewpoint/s. It was also worth it with the thought and presentation that went into the decoration at VP1 specifically. VP2 was also nice and clean. 

The reason for the 4-stars (based on my experience) is because I found it to be overcrowded at VP2 at the time that I went which was around sunset. While I understand that sunset is THE ideal time to go, it would have been nice if the others weren't so loud and smoked so much weed that it made the whole place smell so pungent. Though, I do understand that I may have just been unlucky at the time.

My husband booked this tour before we left and paid a deposit. He was told he would be sent details of where to meet our boat captain the afternoon before the tour & we would need to be at the place where long boats are moored on tonsai bay at 8am. 
When we asked which boat he said no, other side near slinky bar. So we had to walk to the other beach. This is not a big problem, but we were hot & worried after reading other reviews. 
Eventually (around 8:15) he sent a message  with the boat name. It was a long tail that had just arrived. 
The captain put the ladder for the boat out for us & helped us into the boat. He spoke very little but drove us to a site with lots of other boats & said it was for snorkelling & gave us snorkel each. The boat had to stop quite at away from where we were to snorkel. We swam to the shore & it was probably a bit too far for us without life jackets, although we are all very good swimmers.  
The next spot we went to was beautiful & the captain said “for swim” instead of snorkelling. He was spot on, it was no good for snorkelling but we swam a bit. We asked for more snorkelling & he took us just a little further away & had a great opportunity to snorkel. Then we went a loooong way from there (we were unsure where as it seems like back to tonsai bay!) & this was definitely our favourite spot…Nui Bay. There were amazing things to see & a beach of you wanted to swim to it. If we had more time in phi phi we might have gone back via kayak. We snorkelled a bit, had lunch then snorkelled some more. GORGEOUS creatures to see. 
While here we asked what time we’re finished & he said about 20min so we made the list to the snorkelling & then he drove us back to the bay.  
The captain was always very polite but understood pretty much zero English. This was only really a problem at the end when my husband was trying to follow Robert’s instructions to “pay in Thai baht on the day”. He thought that meant pay the captain, so he did. 3000 baht. The captain was very unclear (later Robert explained he was new to his team of captains) but we were sent a receipt by Robert almost immediately. Curiously, later we found the amount was debited from our bank account also. My husband put a hold on the payment & emailed Robert who apologised & tried to explain it but it still didn’t make sense. We’re still not sure what happened but I think he didn’t mean for us to pay the captain cash. We have read all the reviews & we genuinely don’t think Robert is trying to scam anyone, but the communication is not clear. Perhaps it is an issue if lost in translation, also that Robert is the tour organiser but contracts out to captains to run the tours. This the need to send a recent photo & not knowing who he’d assign & where they’d be.
There were life jackets on the boat but we didn’t need to use them really. If you are at a spot where you have to swim a distance from the boat you should take them anyway to feel more security as the best snorkelling is not always right where the boat is. 
Our captain brought fried rice & stuffed omelette for our lunch, one dish each person. They were delicious. He had cut up pineapple & watermelon for us for ‘morning tea’. He also had a small bottle of cold water for each of us.
This was a private tour, only for us & we enjoyed that aspect. Our kids also benefitted from not needing to go places other people might want. 

Tips/FYI
-Ask for very specific & clear details of how much, when & how payment will be made.
-Take your own snorkel. Two of the ones available were very ordinary
-Some of the islands you could be taken to require you to pay for entry. When our captain offered & said that we would have to pay we just said no thank you. If you have particular ideas of where you want to snorkel you can make requests.",1,1,P03018472,Samut Prakan,anger,883289021.0

We spent two days volunteering and were entrusted with walking dogs, on-leash, off-leash, in clean, grassy enclosures, or a purpose built pool area. They run an incredible operation including what has been a highly successful CNVR - catch, neuter, vaccinate, return - program not just in Phuket but other parts of Thailand too. They have an onsite hospital to care for dogs, there are many sections housing dogs (and cats) according to age, (special) needs, etc. and they do their utmost to nurture dogs so that they may return to their community, or be adopted, or be assimilated on-site. I saw videos of adopting families who spoke of how clean, clearly loved, the animals were when they received their new pet at the other end of their plane journey. It was inspiring and heart-warming to see the kindness and humane-ness these animals are experiencing after clearly going through hard lives, as seen in their lack of one or both eyes, one leg, or bearing scars. Volunteering at Soi Dog is a meaningful form of tourism, and also a wonderful opportunity to meet and connect with other traveller-volunteers from far-flung parts of the world. I highly recommend it.

Soi 62 is just a very short and dirty dead end alley with nothing to explore. And you can see that on the sign indicating the right Soi – It says “Saphan Pla”, with means Fish Bridge. I did not see any bridge though.

Soi 58 is five to ten minutes walking from Saphan Taksin Sky Train Station. Just pass the temple named “Wat Yannawa” – the one with the concrete boat – then the Bangkok Dock and you are almost there.

If you “smell something fishy” upon entering the Soi do not worry! Here it means that everything is fine and you have come to the right place. The whole street and the buildings smell like fish, even when the market is closed in the daytime. But it is not too bad, not like it’s rotten, it is just…fish. 

Note that this is not a tourist place. It is a wholesale market where the fisherman’s catch from the night is traded to restaurant owners and fish factories. There are no fancy seafood restaurants anywhere nearby. There is actually nothing nearby that has to do with tourist places or fancy stuff at all.

But the good part is that here you can see and experience real Thai life and you are off the beaten path. If you were looking for places where no Farang – tourist or Bangkok resident – show up, well…you’ve found one!

To be honest, I missed most of the action. I went one day in the afternoon and the market was deserted. I took only some photos of the beautiful graffiti (all related to the ocean in general and fishing in particular) on a wall near the market building. 

The next day I went at six o’clock in the morning and even this was too late. Only three places still showed activity by working on or selling fish. I found out that the busiest time is between midnight and four o’clock. The photo opportunities are seemingly endless, I’ve been told. But remember: You are invading people’s daily work space. It can be rough at times and you should ask for permission to take photos. In Thai the question is: “Tai roop dai mai?”. I always got a positive response and a smile.

We like the lobby. You take your shoes off and, upon entering, sit in a comfortable chair and receive a foot bath while soothing background music plays. Next you're escorted into the massage room.

We didn't like the temperature in the massage room. It was warm and stuffy and, on a 95-degree day, we needed cool. A fan on the wall was circulating at low speed, so I bumped it up a notch, which got the air moving.

Not worth making a planned trip for, but if you’re in the local area and you’ve been to see Wat Phra Sing, then this isn’t too far a walk away.

Absolutely no tourists here and the trees surrounding the temple provide shade from the sun with a nice breeze coming through.

5905,1831068.0,Prasat Puay Noi,NONE,3.0,4.0,"Prasat Pueai Noi is claimed to be the biggest Khmer sanctuary in the upper Northeastern. It is believed to be built in the 16th-17th century to be a place to perform Hindu religious rituals. The sanctuary consists of 3 main buildings and a library surrounded by a moat representing Mount Sumeru. The place is still well preserved and the lintel depicting reclining Vishnu is still rich in detail. However, it is noticeable that it has been renovated. 
	
Prasat Pueai Noi has several good points. Firstly, it is easy to reach as it is located next to the main road. Secondly, in case that you are deep into Khmer sanctuaries (like me), it is a good starting point of your Khmer sanctuary trail in Thailand from Khonkaen down to Sakaew. You can just use it as a stopover as it is small so it doesn’t take much time to look around. Finally, it is free of charge for both entrée and parking. 
	
The bad points of this place are as follows. The first one is that Pueai Noi is 1-hour drive from the heart of Khonkaen so if you are not actually interested in the sanctuary, it might not worth your time. (My house is 20-minute drive to the sanctuary, so I can use this place as a picnic site; it’s perfect for me!). Another bad point of this place is that it is very small compared to other Khmer sanctuaries like ones in Phimai and Phanom Rung. They are a lot bigger and more beautiful. 
	
Overall, I don’t recommend this place to foreign travelers who have limited time. It is better you visit the other two I have mentioned. Be that as it may, I proudly present this sanctuary to local travelers. If you ask me if I will visit this place again, my answer is ‘DEFINITELY!’. It actually depends on one’s point of view to decide if this place is worth a visit. Anyways, I hope my review helps you guys decide whether to visit or not to visit.",1,1,P03013503,Nonthaburi,joy,752115552.0
